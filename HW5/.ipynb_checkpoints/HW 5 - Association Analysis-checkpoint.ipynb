    "# Association Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Association analysis uses machine learning to extract hidden relationships from large datasets. In this assignment you'll be implementing two of the most commonly used algorithms for association rule mining: Apriori and FP-Growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (`large_retail.txt`) that we are going to use for this assignment has been adapted from the [Retail Market Basket Dataset](http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.pdf). The dataset contains transaction records supplied by an anonymous Belgian retail supermarket store. Each line in the file represents a separate transaction with the item ids separated by space. The dataset has 3000 transaction records and 99 different item ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide a smaller dataset (`small_retail.txt`) with 9 transactions and 5 different item ids along with the solutions. *You should first test your implementation on this dataset, before running it on the larger dataset.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be **autograded**. We will use the `diff` command in linux to compare the output files. So please **check your answers** based on the given sample output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `frozenset` data structure in Python (similar to `set` in functionality) to represent the itemsets because `frozenset` is a hashable data structure. You can maintain a dictionary that maps from the itemset (a `frozenset`) to its support count."

    "Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. In this part, you'll be implementing this algorithm for generating the itemsets that occur more than the `min_sup` threshold. Based on these frequent itemsets you'll find association rules that have confidence above the `min_conf` threshold."
